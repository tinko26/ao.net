This repository contains a collection of mostly C# source codes, that I have developed as part of my work in an R&D project on trolley buses. In this project, the team has transformed a diesel bus into an electric bus, equipped with a traction battery, automatic power collectors, and other devices. 

Thereby, I have developed a couple of console and WPF applications in Visual Studio, that capture und analyze sensor and microcontroller data of various vehicle components, using the classes in this repository.
