# Summary

This repository contains a collection of mostly C# source codes, that I have developed as part of my work in an R&D project on trolley buses. In this project, the team has transformed a diesel bus into an electric bus, equipped with a traction battery, automatic power collectors, and other devices. 

Thereby, I have developed a couple of console and WPF applications in Visual Studio, that capture und analyze sensor and microcontroller data of various vehicle components, using the classes in this repository. Topics covered include 

- affine transformations,
- bit manipulation, 
- CAN messages, 
- complex numbers,
- coordinate systems,
- dashcams,
- double-ended queues, 
- emojis,
- event queues,
- geodetic calculations based on GPS data,
- geometric calculations in 2D and 3D,
- J1939 messages, 
- linear equations in various forms,
- logging into text files,
- matrices,
- particle swarm optimization,
- physical quantities,
- priority queues, 
- quaternions,
- serial ports,
- simulations,
- stop watches, 
- timers,
- timestamps in default and high resolution, and
- vectors.
