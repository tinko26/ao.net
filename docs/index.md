# Summary

The [ao.net](https://github.com/tinko26/ao.net) repository contains a collections of mostly C# classes, that I have developed as part of my work in an R&D project on trolley buses. Using these classes, I have created a couple of console and WPF applications in Visual Studio, in order to capture and analyze sensor and microcontroller data of various vehicle components.
