The [ao.net](https://github.com/tinko26/ao.net) repository contains a collection of mostly C# source codes, that I have developed as part of my work in an R&D project on trolley buses. In this project, the team has transformed a diesel bus into an electric bus, equipped with a traction battery, automatic power collectors, and other devices. 

Thereby, I have developed a couple of console and WPF applications in Visual Studio that capture und analyze sensor and microcontroller data of various vehicle components, using the classes in this repository. 

These classes are organized in the following namespaces.

| Namespace | |
|-----------|-|
| [Ao.Bits](namespaces/ao.bits.md) | Manipulating bits in integers |
| [Ao.Can](namespaces/ao.can.md) | Controller Area Network |
| [Ao.Collections](namespaces/ao.collections.md) | Queues |
| [Ao.Dash](namespaces/ao.dash.md) | Dashcams |
| [Ao.Geodesy](namespaces/ao.geodesy.md) | Calculating distances and angles from GPS data |
| [Ao.Geometry](namespaces/ao.geometry.md) | 2D and 3D geometry |
| [Ao.J1939](namespaces/ao.j1939.md) | Vehicle state and diagnostics |
| [Ao.Logging](namespaces/ao.logging.md) | Logging data into text files |
| [Ao.Mathematics](namespaces/ao.mathematics.md) | Numbers, vectors, and matrices |
| [Ao.Measurements](namespaces/ao.measurements.md) | Physical quantities |
| [Ao.Optimization](namespaces/ao.optimization.md) | Particle swarm optimization |
| [Ao.Serial](namespaces/ao.serial.md) | Serial ports |
| [Ao.Simulation](namespaces/ao.simulation.md) | Support for simulations |
| [Ao.Text](namespaces/ao.text.md) | Emojis |
